<h1>TAMAGOTCHI GAME</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>I created a tamagotchi game and its job is to entertain people, it was mostly popular back in the day however I have managed to create an app of it and brought it back to life. Its main purpose is to entertain people of all ages regardless of whatever phone they use. Its meant to bring joy and laughter.
<h3>Motivation</h3>Well the main motivation surrounding the creation of this app is to help put a smile on peoples faces and revive a long lost forgotten game that people used to love and adore. Also incidentaly its also meant to bring back nostalgia to all those people who played when it first came out back in the day.
The build status is it is currently functioning properly and adequalty even if it those have a couple of faults depending on a certain specific brand of phones however it works perfectly fine other than that small hiccup.
<h4>Code Style</h4>The code style isnt something special its basic Kotlin where we used Incrementing to make the progress Bars go up and also go down depending on which buttons you press. Also we use basic kotlin code to link the two screens together so that when a button is clicked on the homepages, it takes the user to the second page where they can then begin to care for their pet.
<h3>Pictures</h3>The following are pictures of what the user interface looks likes, you will find the images in the readme folder to view for your self. here they are : ![alt text](http://url/to/coverpage.jpg)
